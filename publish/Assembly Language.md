# Assembly Language
Even tho the assembly language is way higher level than the machine code, it is still a low level language since it's very close to the hardware and it's used to make programs that are super close to the computer.

Unlike the machine code, the assembly language has some symbols and codes that represent basic operations. but even with that it's still hard to write or read.

This language has to be transformed into machine code to actually run, so a program called assembler does that.
